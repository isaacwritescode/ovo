After our call, we discuss your project internally with all involved people (e.g. designer, developers, project managers) and email you a proposal with a description of our approach, project phases, team composition and timeline`,

    We usually advice to build the design and development from a single source.

Although we love to be involved in all steps along the way, we also provide design-only/development-only work for certain projects. Please get in touch with us to discuss your project`,
